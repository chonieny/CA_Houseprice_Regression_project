# California House Price Predictor: Project Overview
* **Objective**<br/>
This project aims to build an optimal machine learning model to predict the median house price in any district in California.<br/>
Property investors and real estate agents can benefit from being able to accurately predict and know the trends of house prices. 

* **Walkthrough**<br/>
1. Exploratory Data Analysis<br/> 
2. Data Cleaning<br/>
3. Feature Engineering<br/> 
4. Fit Machine Learning Models & Compare their performances<br/> 
5. Hyperparameter Tuning for Final Machine Learning Model 

* **Coding Language Used**<br/> 
Python Version: 3.9<br/>
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn 


## Exploratory Data Analysis
* The distribution of each feature was checked. Log transformation was done on the skewed features, which made their distributions more normal.  
* The median house prices were visualized by location within California. It could be seen that the prices tend to be higher the closer the houses
  are to the ocean.<br/>
