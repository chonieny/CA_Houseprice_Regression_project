# California House Price Predictor: Project Overview
* **Objective**<br/>
This project aims to build an optimal machine learning model to predict the median house price in any district in California.<br/>
Property investors and real estate agents can benefit from being able to accurately predict and know the trends of house prices. 

* **Walkthrough**<br/>
 1. Exploratory Data Analysis<br/> 
 2. Data Cleaning<br/>
 3. Feature Engineering<br/> 
 4. Fit Machine Learning Models & Compare their performances<br/> 
 5. Hyperparameter Tuning for Final Machine Learning Model 

* **Coding Language Used**<br/> 
Python Version: 3.9<br/>
Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn 


## Exploratory Data Analysis
* The distribution of each feature was checked.<br/> 
  Log transformation was done on the skewed features, which made their distributions more normal.  
* The median house prices were visualized by location within California.<br/> 
  It could be seen that the prices tend to be higher the closer the houses are to the ocean.<br/>
* The median house ages were also visualized by location within California.<br/>
  It was apparent that the median age of most of the houses ranged from less than 10 to around 30 years throughout California.<br/>
  Although the very new houses seemed to be more populated in the lower and middle regions of California, there did not seem to be a
  clear pattern of the median age of houses by location.
